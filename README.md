# Projet-Data-Mining
The objective of this project is to develop a system that summarizes web pages related to technology, drones, and an additional topic of your choice using extractive summarization techniques.
This project will be undertaken by a single student with a total of 8 hours allocated for both project development and the preparation of a final presentation.

Part 1: Collection of data – 1 hour

In this phase, you will identify and access multiple websites relevant to the selected topics. A
minimum of 10 web pages should be gathered for each topic. You can use news websites or
technology blogs. Thus, please first make a list of the websites from which you will extract data.


Part 2: Web Data Scraping – 1 hour

To retrieve data from the identified websites, you will utilize a web scraping method. Research
and implement a Python library (such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, or Selenium) suitable for this
purpose to automate the data collection process.


Part 3: Data preprocessing – 1 hour

Following data extraction, the collected information must be preprocessed to ensure it is clean
and ready for summarization. This includes steps such as removing HTML tags, stop words, and
unnecessary characters. Use a Python library like NLTK, spaCy, or similar to perform these
preprocessing steps.


Part 4: Extractive Summarization Using TF-IDF – 2 hours

The core of the project involves applying extractive summarization using the TF-IDF (Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method. A Python library will be used to extract the
most important sentences. You will determine the number of sentences to include in each
summary based on the content.


Part 5: Data post-processing – 1.5 hours

After generating the summaries, similar topics should be combined into cohesive summaries.
Explore different methods for improving readability and structure and choose the most
appropriate solution. Provide a list of potential techniques and describe the ones implemented in
your work. This approach ensures a structured process for building an efficient extractive
summarization system.


Part 6: Presentation Preparation – 1.5 hours

The final part is to prepare a presentation that covers the project objective, methods used (web
scraping, preprocessing, TF-IDF summarization), results, and future work including key
examples of summaries before and after the summarization process.
